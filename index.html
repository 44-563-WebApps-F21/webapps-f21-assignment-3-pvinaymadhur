            <h2>My favourite place is Las vegas.</h2>
            <p>
                Las Vegas means <b>"the meadows"</b> due to water found in underground artesian wells. It is the home to more than half of the 20 largest hotels in the world.
               <b>McCarran International Airport</b> McCarran International Airport is the seventh busiest airport in the United States and North America.Gaming/gambling generally accounts for slightly over 43 percent of Las Vegas casinos revenue.
                A study conducted in 2013 showed that although 15% of people visit primarily for gambling, about 71% do so during their visit anyway.
                Sports wagering accounts to more than 2% of the state’s total income.
