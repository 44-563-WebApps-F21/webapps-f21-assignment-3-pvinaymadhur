            <h2>My favourite place is Las vegas.</h2>
            <p>
                Las Vegas means <b>"the meadows"</b> due to water found in underground artesian wells. It is the home to more than half of the 20 largest hotels in the world.
               <b>McCarran International Airport</b> McCarran International Airport is the seventh busiest airport in the United States and North America.Gaming/gambling generally accounts for slightly over 43 percent of Las Vegas casinos revenue.
                A study conducted in 2013 showed that although 15% of people visit primarily for gambling, about 71% do so during their visit anyway.
                Sports wagering accounts to more than 2% of the stateâ€™s total income.

        <h1>Algebra</h1>
        <blockquote cite="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/algebra/">
            Algebra is a branch of mathematics sibling to geometry, analysis (calculus), number theory, combinatorics, etc. 
            Although algebra has its roots in numerical domains such as the reals and the complex numbers, in its full generality it differs from its siblings in serving no specific mathematical domain. 
            Whereas geometry treats spatial entities, analysis continuous variation, number theory integer arithmetic, and combinatorics discrete structures, algebra is equally applicable to all these and
            other mathematical domains.
